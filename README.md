# Hi

using Expo Router, which is much more easier than State Navigation

adding brackets () around days named folder, which makes it optional to be or not to be in the url

using lots and lots of fonts

using many ways to create the buttons of the days

_layout.tsx defines the styles for all the pages present in its parent folder -> its like style.css

expo alias path is also used to simplify the importing of a file
